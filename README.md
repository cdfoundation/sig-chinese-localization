# CDF Chinese Localization Special Interest Group

## Group Charter

### Introduction

There's a very big number of developers who is the Chinese speaker. But English is not the first language of them. People prefer to search and read documents in Chinese. Especially for the regular users.

### Purpose

The group focuses on promoting projects of CDF in China:
- Translate documents from English to Chinese
- Organize local (or online) meetup of CDF for Chinese speakers
- As an evangelist team to encourage Chinese contributors
- As a bridge between the Chinese and English speakers

### Outcome

The group aims to provide a central place for the developers and users in China. People can get the news of CDF projects. Or communicate with each other in WeChat group which is a super popular tool in China.

Making tutorials for CDF projects is also a meaningful work. Such as [the tutorial videos](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1fp4y1r7Dd) of Jenkins.

### History

Some projects from CDF already have the Chinese localization documentation. Such as [Jenkins X](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jx-docs/tree/main/content/zh), [Jenkins website](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io) and [Jenkins Localization plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/localization-zh-cn-plugin).
